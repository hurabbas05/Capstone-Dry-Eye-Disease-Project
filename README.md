## 🧠 Overview

This healthcare-focused data analysis project explores the behavioral and lifestyle factors contributing to **Dry Eye Disease (DED)** using patient data.By analyzing patient-level data, we identified key risk indicators and visualized trends to support early diagnosis and preventive care.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To uncover high-impact risk factors such as sleep habits, stress levels, screen time, and physical activity — helping healthcare professionals and patients recognize triggers before clinical symptoms intensify.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **📊 Microsoft Excel** — for data cleaning, grouping, and pivot-based analysis  
- **🧮 MySQL** — for structured querying of clinical records  
- **📈 PowerPoint** — to present data narratives and treatment guidelines  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 👩‍⚕️ **Females** showed a slightly higher prevalence of DED than males  
- 💤 **Poor sleep quality**, **short sleep duration**, and **sleep disorders** were major contributing factors  
- 😫 **High stress levels** were strongly correlated with increased DED symptoms  
- 🛋️ **Low physical activity** was also linked with more severe eye discomfort  
- 👁️ Commonly reported symptoms: **Redness**, **Dryness**, **Itchiness**, **Eye Strain**

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ Treatment Recommendations

To minimize DED risk and improve ocular comfort:
- 🔁 Follow the **20-20-20 Rule** (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds)  
- 👁️ Blink regularly, especially during screen time  
- 🖥️ Adjust screen brightness and ergonomic setup  
- 💧 Use lubricating eye drops (e.g., **Systane**) if advised  
- 🛏️ Maintain consistent sleep patterns and schedule regular eye exams

## 📈 Visualized Insights

- Age & Gender prevalence charts  
- Sleep quality vs. DED impact maps  
- Stress segmentation and symptom clustering  
- Activity level comparisons with symptom severity  

---

## 💡 Outcome

This project showcases the potential of **data analytics in clinical decision-making**, offering:
- Early warning indicators for Dry Eye Disease  
- Data-driven recommendations to reduce symptom severity  
- Strong alignment with **preventive optometric care**
